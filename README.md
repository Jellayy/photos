# WIP Photography Page

From scratch rewrite of my photography portfolio because [my current fork](https://github.com/Jellayy/photos.alhuff.com) just ain't cutting it

## Workflow

This page is built on react.js and deploys an optimized build to github pages (ez free hosting). Because of that, this repo has seperate workflows for deploying to two main branches (eventually I should automate this in github itself if possible). 

### Deploying to the `gh-pages` branch

The `gh-pages` branch is what contains the deployment optimized build and actually gets published to github pages. To update this branch run:

``` bash
npm run deploy -- -m "Commit Message"
```

### Updating the `master` branch with page source

The `master` branch is what contains the working source that the `gh-pages` branch is built from. This is what releases will be based on and will not be deployed to github pages. Update this like you would usually update a git branch.

``` bash
git add .
git commit -m "Commit Message"
git push origin master
```

Note: Because I've worked in devops, my master branch is protected out of habit and will only be updated with merge requests. If you shamelessly steal my workflow feel free to manage it however you want.

### More info on this workflow

If you want to use this workflow for your own react website, you can read more about it [here](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).

## Misc React Scripts for Development Cheat Sheet

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
